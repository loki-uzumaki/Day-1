2.A blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
 
 In javascript one of the most powerful features is its ability to manipulate and work with objects.Objects are at the heart of javascripts flexibility,enabling developers to create complex data structures and models.

* Objects : The building blocks
  At its core,an object in javascript is a collection of key-value pairs,where keys are string and values can be of any datatype.

* Object creation
  JavaScript offers multiple ways to create objects: literal notation,constructor functions,and the class syntax.

* The Property chain
  In JavaScript,objects have a hidden `[[property]]` property,often referred to as the prototype chain.This property establishes the inheritance mechanism,allowing obkects to inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.

* Object properties and methods
  Property names are strings or symbols and property values can be any datatype
